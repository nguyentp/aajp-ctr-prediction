# aajp-ctr-prediction

Try several ML algorithms on some CTR datasets. We will pay more attention on the application of algorithms in practice.

The outcomes of this project:

1. The technical report describes the datasets, algorithm, application and performance of each algorithm on each dataset.
2. Source code to generate result.

Some requirments:

1. We will use Kaggle Dataset in this project.
2. We will collect best practices in winning solution (standing on giant's shoulder).
3. Prediction performance must be in top 25th in Private Leaderboard.
